// Restrict the access to contract functionality according to
// suitable criteria.
// Access restriction is achieved by declaring your state variables as
// private. Also functions can be declared 'private', however doing so
// would prevent everyone outside the contract scope from calling it 
// under any circumstances. Simply declaring them 'public', however,
// would open up access to every participant in the network. Most of
// the times it is desired to allow access to functionality in case
// certain rules are met.
// Often the access is supposed to be restricted to a defined set of
// entities, like the administrators of a contract.

// Use the Access Restriction pattern when:
// - contract functions should only be callable under certain
// circumstances,
// - one wants to apply similar restrictions to several functions,
// - one wants to increase security of his smart contract against
// unauthorized access

// Before the Byzantium update, require() and assert() behaved
// identically. Since then the underlying opcodes actually differ. The
// two methods require() and revert() use 0xfd (REVERT) while assert()
// uses 0xfe (INVALID). The big difference between the two opcodes is
// gas return. While REVERT is refunding all of the gas that has not
// been consumed at the time the exception is thrown, INVALID uses up
// all gas included in the transaction.

// The solidity documentation suggests that require() 'should be used
// to ensure valid conditions, such as inputs, or contract state variales
// or to validate return values from calls to external contracts' and
// assert() 'should only be used to test for internal errors, and to
// check invariants'. The revert() throws in every case. It is therefore
// useful in complex situations, like if-else trees, where the evaluation
// of the condition can not be conduced in one line of code and the use 
// of 'require()' would not be fitting.

// Generally 'require()' should be used towards the beginning of a
// function for validation and should be used more often than the other
// two.
