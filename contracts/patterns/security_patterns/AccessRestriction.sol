// Restrict the access to contract functionality according to

// Access restriction is achieved by declaring your state variables as
// private. Also functions can be declared 'private', however doing so
// would prevent everyone outside the contract scope from calling it 
// under any circumstances. Simply declaring them 'public', however,
// would open up access to every participant in the network. Most of
// the times it is desired to allow access to functionality in case
// certain rules are met.
